    <h1>Daniella 💖</h1>
    <p>Here’s why I’m crazy about you...</p>
    <ul class="love-list">
      <li>You make you feel seen – not just looked at, but understood without saying a word.</li>
      <li>Your presence is peace – you walk in and the chaos in my mind quiets down.</li>
      <li>I love it when you nag or get mad — you're always so cute.</li>
      <li>You’ve got an amazing body (and yes, I notice!).</li>
      <li>You challenges me to be better – not by force, but by inspiring me.</li>
      <li>Your smile can fix your worst days – like medicine, without the prescription.</li>
      <li>You listen, truly listen – not just waiting to speak, but trying to understand.</li>
      <li>You're my soft place in a hard world – a home in human form.</li>
      <li>You believe in me, even when I don’t – that quiet faith in my potential.</li>
      <li>You respect my hustle – and never make me feel small for dreaming big.</li>
      <li> Your laugh is a sound I crave – it lights up parts of me I didn’t know existed.</li>
      <li>You're emotionally intelligent – you gets the vibe without needing the explanation.</li>
      <li>With you, I'm not just living — I'm alive.</li>
      <p>WANT ME TO GO ON!!!!!!😩😭</p>
