    <h1>Daniella, I Love You</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3em; margin-top: 20px;">
      I’ve been holding this in for too long, and it’s time I said it clearly…</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.6em; font-weight: bold; color: #e91e63; margin: 30px 0;">
      I’m in love with you, Daniella. 🥺❤</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
      I don’t even know where to start because words will never be enough. But I need you to know this: you’re not just someone I care about — you’re someone who’s changed my entire world. Every time I think of you, it’s like my pain fades away. My worries grow silent. It’s just peace… and warmth… and you. Your smile is a place I want to live in. Your laugh is music I want to hear for the rest of my life.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
      Even when you get mad, or when you nag — I swear, it only makes you cuter. You don’t even know how deeply you affect me. You’ve got this beauty, not just in how you look (which, God knows, is a masterpiece), but in how you carry your soul. You’re real, kind, bold, and absolutely unforgettable</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
        The moments we’ve shared… I hold them close. Time with you? Never wasted. Every second counts. Every moment matters.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
     Daniella, I’m not perfect. But if there’s one thing I’ll always be sure of, it’s how much I love you. Not for what you give me… but for who you are.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
      If you ever doubt it, come back to this page. My love for you is real, Daniella.  
      Always and forever. ❤
